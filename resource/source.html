<p>Sorry this is the most lazzy webpage in the history of webpages.
Orokonui Monitoring is an open source project, so here's the source.
However I'm not looking to make this a contributable project, but go
ahead and fork it if you want. This is more here as a placeholder, while
I'm developing, once it's finished I'll update the page and link to the docs
 and stuff and things. But for now, <a href='lib/SC.zip'>download source 0.1</a></p>
